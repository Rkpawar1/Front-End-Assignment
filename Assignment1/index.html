		<img src="image/java.jpg">
                <p>Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.
                   Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java.
                   Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company,
                   so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java..</p>
		   <h3>Java Example</h3>
                   <p> Let's have a quick look at Java programming example. A detailed description of Hello Java example is available in next page.
                    Simple.java<br>

                    class Simple{  <br>
                    public static void main(String args[]){  <br>
                    System.out.println("Hello Java");  <br>
                    }  <br>
                    }  <br>

                <h2>Java Features</h2>
                <h4>Features of Java</h4>
                <p>The primary objective of <strong>Java</strong> programming language creation was to make it portable, simple and secure programming language. 
                   Apart from this, there are also some excellent features which play an important role in the popularity of this language. 
                   The features of Java are also known as Java buzzwords.</p>
		  <h3>Simple</h3>
                  <p>Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand. According to Sun Microsystem, Java language is a simple programming language because:
                  Java syntax is based on C++ (so easier for programmers to learn it after C++).
                  Java has removed many complicated and rarely-used features, for example, explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc.
                  There is no need to remove unreferenced objects because there is an Automatic Garbage Collection in Java.</p>
		  <h4> Object-oriented</h4>
                  <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object. Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behavior.
                  Object-oriented programming (OOPs) is a methodology that simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some rules.<br>

                 Basic concepts of OOPs are:<br>

                 Object<br>
                 Class<br>
                 Inheritance<br>
                 Polymorphism<br>
                 Abstraction<br>
                 Encapsulation</p>

            <section id="Java Virtual Machine">
                <h2>Java Virtual Machine</h2>
                <p>JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.
                   JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms 
		   A specification where working of Java Virtual Machine is specified. But implementation provider is independent to choose the algorithm.
		   Its implementation has been provided by Oracle and other companies.
                   An implementation Its implementation is known as JRE (Java Runtime Environment).
                   Runtime Instance Whenever you write java command on the command prompt to run the java class, an instance of JVM is created.</p>
