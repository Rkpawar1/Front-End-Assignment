				   ReactJS tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of ReactJS. Currently, ReactJS is one of the most popular JavaScript front-end libraries which has a strong foundation and a large community.
                   ReactJS is a <strong>declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library</strong> for building reusable UI components. It is an open-source, component-based front end library which is responsible only for the view layer of the application. 
                   It was initially developed and maintained by Facebook and later used in its products like WhatsApp & Instagram.
                   Our ReactJS tutorial includes all the topics which help to learn ReactJS. These are ReactJS Introduction, ReactJS Features, ReactJS Installation, Pros and Cons of ReactJS, ReactJS JSX, ReactJS Components, ReactJS State, ReactJS Props, ReactJS Forms, ReactJS Events, ReactJS Animation and many more.

            <section id="React Features">
                <h2>React Features</h2>
                <p> Currently, ReactJS gaining quick popularity as the best JavaScript framework among web developers. It is playing an essential role in the front-end ecosystem.<br> 
				    The important features of ReactJS are as following.<br>
                    <strong>JSX<br>
                    Components<br>
                    One-way Data Binding<br>
                    Virtual DOM<br>
                    Simplicity<br>
                    Performance<br></strong>
                    <h4>JSX</h4>
                    JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a JavaScript syntax extension. Its an XML or HTML like syntax used by ReactJS. This syntax is processed into JavaScript calls of React Framework. It extends the ES6 so that HTML like text can co-exist with JavaScript react code. It is not necessary to use JSX, but it is recommended to use in ReactJS.

                    <h4>Components</h4>
                    ReactJS is all about components. ReactJS application is made up of multiple components, and each component has its own logic and controls. These components can be reusable which help you to maintain the code when working on larger scale projects.

                    <h4>One-way Data Binding</h4>
                    ReactJS is designed in such a manner that follows unidirectional data flow or one-way data binding. The benefits of one-way data binding give you better control throughout the application. If the data flow is in another direction, then it requires additional features. It is because components are supposed to be immutable and the data within them cannot be changed. Flux is a pattern that helps to keep your data unidirectional. This makes the application more flexible that leads to increase efficiency.

                    <h4>Virtual DOM</h4>
                    A virtual DOM object is a representation of the original DOM object. It works like a one-way data binding. Whenever any modifications happen in the web application, the entire UI is re-rendered in virtual DOM representation. Then it checks the difference between the previous DOM representation and new DOM. Once it has done, the real DOM will update only the things that have actually changed. This makes the application faster, and there is no wastage of memory.

                    <h4>Simplicity</h4>
                    ReactJS uses JSX file which makes the application simple and to code as well as understand. We know that ReactJS is a component-based approach which makes the code reusable as your need. This makes it simple to use and learn.

                    <h4>Performance</h4>
                    ReactJS is known to be a great performer. This feature makes it much better than other frameworks out there today. The reason behind this is that it manages a virtual DOM. The DOM is a cross-platform and programming API which deals with HTML, XML or XHTML. The DOM exists entirely in memory. Due to this, when we create a component, we did not write directly to the DOM. Instead, we are writing virtual components that will turn into the DOM leading to smoother and faster performance.

                <h2>ReactJS Installation</h2>
                <p><h4>React Environment Setup</h4><br>
                   In this section, we will learn how to set up an environment for the successful development of ReactJS application.<br>

                   <h4>Pre-requisite for ReactJS</h4><br>
                   NodeJS and NPM<br>
                   React and React DOM<br>
                   Webpack<br>
                   Babel<br>
                   <h4>Ways to install ReactJS</h4>
                   There are two ways to set up an environment for successful ReactJS application. They are given below.<br>

                   Using the npm command<br>
                   Using the create-react-app command<br>
                   1. Using the npm command<br>
                   2.Install NodeJS and NPM<br>

                   NodeJS and NPM are the platforms need to develop any ReactJS application. You can install NodeJS and NPM package manager by the link given below.<br>

                   https://www.javatpoint.com/install-nodejs-on-linux-ubuntu-centos<br>
                   To verify NodeJS and NPM, use the command shown in the below image.<br>

                   <h4>React Environment Setup</h4>
                   Install React and React DOM<br>

                   Create a root folder with the name reactApp on the desktop or where you want. Here, we create it on the desktop. You can create the folder directly or using the command given below.<br>

                  <h4> React Environment Setup</h4>
                   Now, you need to create a package.json file. To create any module, it is required to generate a package.json file in the project folder. To do this, you need to run the following command as shown in the below image.<br>

                  javatpoint@root:~/Desktop/reactApp> npm init -y  <br>

                  <h4>React Environment Setup</h4>
                  After creating a package.json file, you need to install react and its DOM packages using the following npm command in the terminal window as shown in the below image.<br>

                  javatpoint@root:~/Desktop/reactApp>npm install react react-dom --save  <br>

                  <h4>React Environment Setup</h4><br>
                  You can also use the above command separately which can be shown as below.<br>
