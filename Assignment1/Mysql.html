                <p>MySQL tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of MySQL. Our MySQL tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.
				   MySQL is a relational database management system based on the Structured Query Language, which is the popular language for accessing and managing the records in the database. 
                   MySQL is open-source and free software under the GNU license. It is supported by <strong>Oracle Company.</strong></p>
					<h3>How MySQL Works</h3>
                    <p> MySQL follows the working of Client-Server Architecture. This model is designed for the end-users called clients to access the resources from a central computer known as
				       a server using network services. Here, the clients make requests through a graphical user interface (GUI), and the server will give the desired output as soon as the instructions are matched.
				      The process of MySQL environment is the same as the client-server model.

                <h2>Reasons for popularity</h2>
               
                <p>MySQL is becoming so popular because of these following reasons:<br>
                   MySQL is an open-source database, so you don't have to pay a single penny to use it.<br>
                   MySQL is a very powerful program that can handle a large set of functionality of the most expensive and powerful database packages.<br>
                   MySQL is customizable because it is an open-source database, and the open-source GPL license facilitates programmers to modify the SQL software according to their own specific environment.<br>
                   MySQL is quicker than other databases, so it can work well even with the large data set.<br>
                   MySQL supports many operating systems with many languages like PHP, PERL, C, C++, JAVA, etc.<br>
                   MySQL uses a standard form of the well-known SQL data language.<br>
                   MySQL is very friendly with PHP, the most popular language for web development.<br>
                   MySQL supports large databases, up to 50 million rows or more in a table. The default file size limit for a table is 4GB, <br>
                   but you can increase this (if your operating system can handle it) to a theoretical limit of 8 million terabytes (TB).</p>

            <section id="MySQL Features">
                <h2>MySQL Features</h2>
                <p>MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) based on the SQL (Structured Query Language) queries. It is one of the most popular languages for accessing and managing the records in the table. MySQL is open-source and free software under the GNU license. Oracle Company supports it.

                  The following are the most important features of MySQL:<br>

                  <h4>Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)</h4>

                  MySQL is a relational database management system. This database language is based on the SQL queries to access and manage the records of the table.

                  <h4>Easy to use</h4>

                  MySQL is easy to use. We have to get only the basic knowledge of SQL. We can build and interact with MySQL by using only a few simple SQL statements.

                  <h4>It is secure</h4>

                  MySQL consists of a solid data security layer that protects sensitive data from intruders. Also, passwords are encrypted in MySQL.

                  <h4>Client/ Server Architecture</h4>

                  MySQL follows the working of a client/server architecture. There is a database server (MySQL) and arbitrarily many clients (application programs), which communicate with the server; that is, they can query data, save changes, etc.

                  <h4>Free to download</h4>

                  MySQL is free to use so that we can download it from MySQL official website without any cost.

                  <h4>It is scalable</h4>

                  MySQL supports multi-threading that makes it easily scalable. It can handle almost any amount of data, up to as much as 50 million rows or more. The default file size limit is about 4 GB. However, we can increase this number to a theoretical limit of 8 TB of data.

                  <h4>Speed</h4>

                  MySQL is considered one of the very fast database languages, backed by a large number of the benchmark test.

                  <h4>High Flexibility</h4>

                  MySQL supports a large number of embedded applications, which makes MySQL very flexible.</p>
